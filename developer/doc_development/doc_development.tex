\begin{frame}{Overview of the OpenTURNS documentation}
The OpenTURNS documentation is built using the Python \href{https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/index.html}{\alert{Sphinx}} package.

One of the Continuous Integration machines (CircleCI \texttt{build-linux})
produces the documentation and publishes it online.
Several versions are online:

\begin{itemize}
\item The version corresponding to the current release has \alert{\texttt{latest}} in its URL:
\url{https://openturns.github.io/openturns/latest/}
\item The version corresponding to the master branch has \alert{\texttt{master}} in its URL:
\url{https://openturns.github.io/openturns/master/}
\item Older versions are accessible with the version number: \url{https://openturns.github.io/openturns/1.17/}
\end{itemize}

If you spot a mistake, make sure you are looking at \texttt{master} before correcting!

The built-in search engine distinguishes between 3 main sections:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \alert{Examples}
    \item \alert{API} (user manual)
    \item \alert{Theory}
\end{itemize}

You may also want to check out:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \alert{Contribute} (developer guide)
    \item \alert{Common use cases} (added in 2020)
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Looking up the source file of a theory page}

What holds for the \alert{Theory} section also mostly holds for the \alert{Contribute} (developer guide) and \alert{Common use cases} sections.

Let us consider the \alert{Using QQ-plot to compare two samples} page:

\url{https://openturns.github.io/openturns/master/theory/data_analysis/qqplot_graph.html}

All Theory files are RST and the URL fits the source folder structure, so the relevant source file is:

\href{https://github.com/openturns/openturns/blob/master/python/doc/theory/data_analysis/qqplot_graph.rst}{\texttt{python/doc/theory/data\_analysis/qqplot\_graph.rst}}

There are great RST and Sphinx \href{https://thomas-cokelaer.info/tutorials/sphinx/rest_syntax.html}{\alert{cheatsheet}} available,
but here are the basics:

\begin{itemize}
    \item A page can be \alert{indexed} as \texttt{page\_name} by writing \texttt{.. \_page\_name:} at the top.
    \item Because of this, that page can be \alert{linked} to from anywhere in the doc with \texttt{:ref:`page\_name`}
    \item \alert{Titles} are underlined (the number of underlining characters must match the title).
    \item \alert{Inline math} is \LaTeX{} code with \texttt{\$a=b\$} replaced with \texttt{:math:`a=b`}.
    \item \alert{Display math} is \LaTeX{} code with \texttt{\$\$a=b\$\$} replaced with
    
    \texttt{.. math::}
    
    \texttt{~~~~a = b}
    \item \alert{Macros} are defined in \href{https://github.com/openturns/openturns/blob/master/python/doc/math_notations.sty}{\texttt{python/doc/math\_notations.sty}}
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile]{Adding a new theory page}
Code of the main table of contents (\href{https://github.com/openturns/openturns/blob/master/python/doc/theory/theory.rst}{python/doc/theory/theory.rst}):

\begin{lstlisting}
.. _theory:

======

======

The theoretical documentation.
This contains an in-depth description of all algorithms.

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 2

    data_analysis/data_analysis.rst
    probabilistic_modeling/probabilistic_modeling.rst
    meta_modeling/meta_modeling.rst
    reliability_sensitivity/reliability_sensitivity.rst
    numerical_methods/numerical_methods.rst
\end{lstlisting}
Table of contents of subdirectories are essentially the same.
\end{frame}

\section{Examples}

\againframe{tableofcontents}


\begin{frame}{Looking up the source Python script of an example}

The Examples section is produced by \href{https://sphinx-gallery.github.io/stable/index.html}{\alert{Sphinx-gallery}}, a Sphinx extension.

Let us consider the \alert{Kriging with an isotropic covariance function} example:

\url{https://openturns.github.io/openturns/master/auto_meta_modeling/kriging_metamodel/plot_kriging_isotropic.html}

Example source files are \alert{Python scripts}.
The URL is still linked to the the source folder structure,
but the \texttt{auto\_} part is a Sphinx-gallery artifact. Its source file is:

\href{https://github.com/openturns/openturns/blob/master/python/doc/examples/meta_modeling/kriging_metamodel/plot_kriging_isotropic.py}{\texttt{python/doc/examples/meta\_modeling/kriging\_metamodel/\\plot\_kriging\_isotropic.py}}

Example Python scripts can be viewed as RST-based Jupyter notebook source files.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Use \alert{\texttt{\# \%\%}} to start a \alert{new cell}.
    \item Write \alert{Python code} as you \alert{normally} would.
    \item Write \alert{text as RST code}, but each RST line must start with \alert{\texttt{\#}}.
    \item A cell can contain both RST and Python code, but \alert{RST must come first}.  
    \item A page can be \alert{indexed} as \texttt{page\_name} by writing \texttt{.. \_page\_name:} at the top.
    \item A \alert{blank line} interrupts RST code and \alert{switches to Python}. For the remainder of the cell, lines starting with \alert{\texttt{\#}} are simply interpreted as Python comments.
    \item By default, the first image is used as \alert{thumbnail picture}. To use e.g. the third: %$n$\textsuperscript{rd} image:%, write (preferably right above the code that produces the image):

    \texttt{\# sphinx\_gallery\_thumbnail\_number = 3} (ideally right above the plot code)
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Adding a new example}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Normally, you should not need to change \href{https://github.com/openturns/openturns/blob/master/python/doc/examples/examples.rst}{\texttt{python/doc/examples/examples.rst}}.
    \item Every subfolder has a \alert{\texttt{README.txt}} file, which is actually an RST file that only contains a label for hypertext links and the subsection title.
    \item All source Python scripts are \alert{automatically detected} and used to build HTML examples and the corresponding thumbnails, provided their name follows the \texttt{plot\_xxx.py} template.
    \item \alert{No need to index the files}, just put them in the appropriate subfolder.
    \item You can use the \alert{docstring} at the start of the file not only to write the title of the example, but also the introductory text. This docstring is the only part of the script that is interpreted as RST code without a \alert{\texttt{\#}} at the start of every line.
    \item \alert{Hypertext links} help users connect various aspects of the library:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \texttt{:class:`\textasciitilde.openturns.ClassName`} to link to the API doc of a class.
        \item \texttt{:meth:`\textasciitilde.openturns.ClassName.method`} to link to the API doc of a class method.
        \item \texttt{:ref:`\_theory\_page`} to link to a Theory doc page using its RST label.
        \item \texttt{:doc:`/auto\_category/subcategory/plot\_xxx`} (no \texttt{.py}) to link to another example.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{API (user manual)}

\againframe{tableofcontents}


\begin{frame}
\frametitle{SWIG: Simplified Wrapper and Interface Generator}
\begin{block}{A tool to link C/C++ libraries with script languages}
    SWIG parses the library headers (\texttt{.hxx}) and swig interface files (\texttt{.i}) to
    generate the corresponding module source that must be compiled to
    produce a binary Python module.
\end{block}
\centering \resizebox{!}{4cm}{\includegraphics{swig.png}} \medskip

Python \alert{docstrings} are written in \texttt{\_doc.i.in} files which supplement the \alert{SWIG} \texttt{.i} files.

These docstrings are then read by \alert{Sphinx} to build the API doc section.
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Looking up the sources of docstrings}
Let us consider the \alert{LinearCombinationFunction} class:
\url{https://openturns.github.io/openturns/master/user_manual/_generated/openturns.LinearCombinationFunction.html}

Corresponding source file:
\href{https://github.com/openturns/openturns/blob/master/python/src/LinearCombinationFunction_doc.i.in}{python/\alert{src}/LinearCombinationFunction\_doc.i.in}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Docstring sources are in \texttt{src} rather than \texttt{doc} because they are part of the library.
    \item A docstring is just a string \texttt{"..."}: double quotes are thus forbidden inside, use \texttt{'...'} instead (not to be confused with \texttt{`...`} as in \texttt{:math:`...`}). Do not put any whitespace between the opening \texttt{"} and the first docstring character, nor between the last docstring character and the closing \texttt{"}.
    \item Docstrings follow \href{https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html}{\alert{Numpydoc}} style.
    \item Example code lines start with \texttt{>{}>{}>} and are run during Python tests! If you call \texttt{print}, you need to specify the expected output or the test will fail.
    \item Class inheritance extends to docstrings: in this example, \texttt{LinearCombinationFunction} inherits all its method docstrings from \alert{\texttt{FunctionImplementation}}: look for the docstrings in \href{https://github.com/openturns/openturns/blob/master/python/src/FunctionImplementation_doc.i.in}{\texttt{python/src/FunctionImplementation\_doc.i.in}}.
    \item \texttt{FunctionImplementation} has no HTML page, although it has many docstrings.
    Instead, those docstrings are used to produce the \href{https://openturns.github.io/openturns/master/user_manual/_generated/openturns.Function.html}{\alert{HTML file}}
    of \href{https://github.com/openturns/openturns/blob/master/python/src/Function_doc.i.in}{\alert{Function}}.
    This holds for almost all Interface/Implementation couples.
\end{itemize}
    
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Docstrings of a new class and/or method: SWIG part}
To get the \alert{docstrings} to appear \alert{in the Python library}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Create a \alert{docstring file} \texttt{python/src/MyClass\_doc.i.in}
    \item Declare the \alert{class docstring}: \texttt{\%feature("docstring") OT::MyClass}
    \item Declare a \alert{method docstring}: \texttt{\%feature("docstring") OT::MyClass::myMethod}
    \item Two ways are available to actually create the docstring:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Write the docstring between double-quotes \alert{right under the declaration}.
        \item \alert{Make it a variable} so it can be used in several different places:

        \texttt{\%define OT\_MyClass\_(myMethod)\_doc}

        \texttt{"..."}

        \texttt{\%enddef}
    \end{enumerate}
    \item For a new class, \alert{do not forget to declare} the docstrings in \texttt{MyClass.i}:

    \texttt{\%include MyClass\_doc.i}
    \item For a new Interface/Implementation couple, define the docstrings in \texttt{XxxImplementation\_doc.i.in} with \alert{\texttt{\%define}} to be able to reuse them in the Interface docstrings file \texttt{Xxx\_doc.i.in}: see \href{https://github.com/openturns/openturns/blob/master/python/src/Function_doc.i.in}{\texttt{python/src/Function\_doc.i.in}} and \href{https://github.com/openturns/openturns/blob/master/python/src/FunctionImplementation_doc.i.in}{\texttt{python/src/FunctionImplementation\_doc.i.in}} for example.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Docstrings of a new class: Sphinx part}
Sphinx looks at \href{https://github.com/openturns/openturns/tree/master/python/doc/user_manual}{\texttt{python/\alert{doc}/user\_manual}} for the structure of the API documentation.

For example, \href{https://openturns.github.io/openturns/master/user_manual/_generated/openturns.LinearCombinationFunction.html}{\alert{LinearCombinationFunction}} is referenced in \href{https://github.com/openturns/openturns/blob/master/python/doc/user_manual/functions.rst}{\texttt{python/doc/user\_manual/functions.rst}}

To get your new class to appear in the \alert{HTML API doc} section:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Find the \alert{RST file} of the appropriate subsection.
    \item \alert{Insert the name} of your class where you want it to appear.
    \item Make sure it uses the correct \alert{template}, otherwise use the \texttt{:template:} directive.
\end{itemize}

Templates are found in the \href{https://github.com/openturns/openturns/tree/master/python/doc/_templates}{\texttt{python/doc/\_templates}} folder. The main templates are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \href{https://github.com/openturns/openturns/blob/master/python/doc/_templates/class.rst_t}{\alert{\texttt{class.rst\_t}}}
    \item \href{https://github.com/openturns/openturns/blob/master/python/doc/_templates/classWithPlot.rst_t}{\alert{\texttt{classWithPlot.rst\_t}}}
\end{itemize}

If you want to use \texttt{classWithPlot.rst\_t}, you need to provide the code to generate the graph at the top of the page. For example, \href{https://openturns.github.io/openturns/master/user_manual/_generated/openturns.LinearCombinationFunction.html}{\alert{LinearCombinationFunction}} runs the code in
\href{https://github.com/openturns/openturns/blob/master/python/doc/pyplots/LinearCombinationFunction.py}{\texttt{\alert{python/doc/pyplots}/LinearCombinationFunction.py}}.

Note that the plot code can be downloaded from the API doc page itself by clicking on ``\emph{Source code}''.
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Summary of the previous parts}
Two tools are involved in the creation of the documentation.

\textbf{Sphinx}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Theory files: \texttt{python/\alert{doc}/theory}
    \item Example files: \texttt{python/\alert{doc}/examples}
    \item API tables of contents: \texttt{python/\alert{doc}/user\_manual}
    \item API plots: \texttt{python/\alert{doc}/pyplots}
    \item Math notations are defined in \href{https://github.com/openturns/openturns/blob/master/python/doc/math_notations.sty}{\texttt{python/\alert{doc}/math\_notations.sty}}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{SWIG}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item API docstrings: \texttt{*\_doc.i.in} files in \texttt{python/\alert{src}}
\end{itemize}

Docstrings are in \texttt{python/\alert{src}} because they are part of the Python library and not only the HTML documentation.

\end{frame}

\section{Tips and tricks}

\againframe{tableofcontents}


\begin{frame}{Quickly find the appropriate source file}

The GitHub \href{https://github.com/openturns/openturns/find/master}{``\alert{\emph{Go to file}}''} button does wonders to find the source file you need.

\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Github_gotofile}

\begin{itemize}
    \item API: simply type the class name.
    \item Examples: scroll down to ``\alert{\emph{Download Python source code}}'' for the script name.
    \item Theory: click on ``\alert{\emph{Show source}}'', the exact \texttt{.rst} file name appears in the URL.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Tip for reviewers: always look at the HTML output, not the source file!}
CircleCI \texttt{build\_linux} builds the doc in addition to the library when a PR is submitted.

For easy access, click on the ``\alert{\emph{Details}}'' link of the \texttt{build\_linux artifact} ``check''.

\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{Github_checks}

\begin{itemize}
    \item The \texttt{build\_linux artifact} pseudo-check ``succeeds'' if, and only if, the \texttt{build\_linux} check succeds.
    This means that a test failure could cause a red cross to appear in front of both of them, even though the doc was actually successfully generated.
    \item If the person submitting the Pull Request has CircleCI set up on their fork, then the \texttt{build\_linux artifact} link is always broken regardless of whether or not the doc was successfully built. You can still access it through the ``\alert{\emph{Artifacts}}'' tab in CircleCI after clicking on the \texttt{build\_linux} ``\alert{\emph{Details}}'' link.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Build the documentation with the library}
    Pass the following option to \alert{CMake} in order to build the doc with the library:
    
    \texttt{-DSPHINX\_FLAGS="-j6"} (to build with 6 cores)

    Pass the following option to \alert{CMake} in order to \alert{not} build the doc:
    
    \texttt{-DUSE\_SPHINX=OFF}

    Building the doc takes a while if you build from scratch. It is much shorter afterwards.
\end{frame}


\newcounter{enumindex}

\begin{frame}{Quick patch to the doc (1/2)}
You can patch the doc directly from GitHub:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Go to the \alert{master} branch of the official repository: \url{https://github.com/openturns/openturns}
    \item Find the file you want to edit (with ``\alert{\emph{Go to file}}'' for example).
    \item Click on the pencil button.
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{Github_edit}
    \item Make your change and click on ``\alert{\emph{Preview changes}}'' to make sure you have not made any mistake.
    \item Scroll down to write the title (with \alert{50 characters or fewer}) and the body of your commit message. You \alert{cannot edit more than one file} in a GitHub commit.
    \item Click on ``\alert{\emph{Propose changes}}'' to:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Create a new \texttt{patch-1} (or more) branch on your fork.
        \item Validate the commit.
    \end{itemize}
    \setcounter{enumindex}{\value{enumi}}
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Quick patch to the doc (2/2)}
\begin{enumerate}
    \setcounter{enumi}{\value{enumindex}}
    \item GitHub will ask if you want to create a \alert{Pull Request}. If you accept, you are done!
    \item If you want to \alert{add more commits} to your newly created branch, close the tab.
    \item Go to \alert{your fork} and select the \alert{\texttt{patch-1}} (for example) branch from the menu.
    \item \alert{Edit} a file as before and create a \alert{new commit}.
    \item After you have created all the commits you want, create a \alert{Pull Request}.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Advantage} of this method:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Do everything \alert{remotely}. No need to worry about local/remote branches.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Drawbacks} of this method:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Only \alert{one file} can be changed \alert{per commit}.
    \item \alert{No way to inspect} the HTML output before pushing.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Build select parts of the documentation without the library with \texttt{docfast.py}}
The Python script \href{https://github.com/openturns/openturns/blob/master/utils/docfast.py}{\texttt{utils/\alert{docfast.py}}} can build selected parts of the library and only requires OpenTURNS to be installed, not necessarily compiled.

\textbf{Prerequisites}: python 3.8+, sphinx, sphinx-gallery, numpydoc, openturns, matplotlib.

\texttt{\$ docfast.py build-sphinxonly smirnov\_test.rst plot\_smoothing\_mixture.py}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{build-sphinxonly} is the name of the \alert{build folder}: HTML output files will be stored in \texttt{build-sphinxonly/install}
    \item \href{https://github.com/openturns/openturns/blob/master/python/doc/theory/data_analysis/smirnov_test.rst}{\texttt{smirnov\_test.rst}} is the source file of the \href{https://openturns.github.io/openturns/master/theory/data_analysis/smirnov_test.html}{\alert{Kolmogorov-Smirnov two samples test}} theory page.
    \item \texttt{plot\_smoothing\_mixture.py} is the source file of the
    \href{https://github.com/openturns/openturns/blob/master/python/doc/examples/data_analysis/distribution_fitting/plot_smoothing_mixture.py}{\alert{Bandwidth sensitivity in kernel smoothing}} example.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Advantages} of this method:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \alert{Fast}: the command above only builds one example and one theory page.
    \item Does \alert{not} require a \alert{full compilation} environment.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Drawbacks} of this method:
\begin{itemize}
    \item If the installed version ot OpenTURNS is older than \texttt{master}, examples relying on \alert{new classes or methods will fail}.
    \item Since it does not use SWIG, \alert{how can it deal with docstrings?}
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Docstring handling with \texttt{docfast.py}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Recall: docstring source files are stored in
    \texttt{python/\alert{src}} as \texttt{\_doc.i.in} files.
    \item \alert{Sphinx} does not deal with them: that is part of \alert{SWIG}'s job.
    \item In a normal build, SWIG creates the Python library \alert{with the docstrings}.
    \item Sphinx reads the docstrings in the Python library, \alert{not its source files}.
\end{itemize}

Since Sphinx reads the docstrings of the installed OpenTURNS Python library, \texttt{docstring.py}
attempts to \alert{patch} them with the changes made to the \texttt{python/src/*\_doc.i.in} source files.

By default, it relies on \alert{\texttt{git diff}}: this only takes unstaged changes into account. \newline
You can pass an additional argument to \texttt{git diff} with the \alert{\texttt{-{}-diff}} option:

\texttt{\$ docfast.py -{}-diff master ...} uses \texttt{git diff master} instead.

Regardless, to tell \texttt{docfast.py} which API page(s) it needs to build, you need to pass the name of a file from \texttt{python/\alert{doc}/user\_manual}. They are RST table of content files.

\texttt{\$ docfast.py [-{}-diff master] functions.rst plot\_smoothing\_mixture.py}

Unfortunately, docstring patches can fail in various ways. \newline
To disable them and build from the installed docstrings, use the \alert{\texttt{-{}-nodiff}} option:

\texttt{\$ docfast.py -{}-nodiff functions.rst plot\_smoothing\_mixture.py}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Content guideline}

The goal of this section is to present some guidelines on the content of 
the help pages.

We can select where to write an example depending on the content.
\begin{itemize}
\item in API: the example shows how to use that particular class, whatever the purpose
\item in Examples: the example shows how to combine several classes, to make 
something useful in UQ
\end{itemize}

Whatever the location of the Python script it should be properly 
formatted according to the PEP8 \footnote{\url{https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/}}. 
Use black\footnote{\url{https://github.com/psf/black}} to format it automatically if 
needed. 

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{API example: always document the \emph{flagship}.}


In the API documentation, the most significant method should have an 
example within the main section, on the top of the help page. 
This main example should document the \emph{flagship} of the class, that is, 
the most significant method(s) of the class. 

For example, one of the main features of the \texttt{LinearEnumerateFunction} class is its 
evaluation operator, which is why the first example is:

\begin{lstlisting}
import openturns as ot
enumerateFunction = ot.LinearEnumerateFunction(2, 0.5)
for i in range(10):
    print(enumerateFunction(i))
\end{lstlisting}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Examples section: write interesting english}
In the Examples section, the english content should be an interesting explanation 
of the Python content. 

Do not write:
\par\noindent\rule{\textwidth}{0.4pt}
\textit{
Draw the function
}

\begin{lstlisting}
n = 10000
sampleX = im.distributionX.getSample(n)
sampleY = im.model(sampleX)
[...]
plotXvsY(sampleX, sampleY, figsize=(10, 4))
\end{lstlisting}
\par\noindent\rule{\textwidth}{0.4pt}
Write:
\par\noindent\rule{\textwidth}{0.4pt}
\textit{
In the next cell, we create a large sample of the input random vector 
and evaluate the corresponding output from the physical model. 
We then create a function which take 
the input and output samples as input argument and create a grid 
of scatter plots. 
}

\begin{lstlisting}
n = 10000
sampleX = im.distributionX.getSample(n)
sampleY = im.model(sampleX)
[...]
plotXvsY(sampleX, sampleY, figsize=(10, 4))
\end{lstlisting}

\textit{
We see that the variance of the output is mostly sensitive to the first variable X1. 
The variance of the output is not sensitive to the third 
variable, since the conditional variance is zero. 
}
