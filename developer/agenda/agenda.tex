  \frametitle{The developers training : objectives}
%  \begin{block}{Objectives}
    This 4 days training will give you the first elements to:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Understand the OpenTURNS aim and architecture,
    \item Discover the coding rules, the development process and the associated infrastructure,
    \item Make your first steps in the OpenTURNS development by adding a new specialization of an existing concept both in the C++ library and the Python interface,
    \item Make your first steps in the OpenTURNS module development.
    \end{itemize}

    \item[9.45am] Theory
    \item[12.15pm] Lunch
    \item[13.15pm] Theory or experimentation
    \item[15.15pm] Break (coffee \& tea)

  \begin{block}{Day 1: uncertainties, OpenTURNS platform, architecture}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Uncertainties: quick reminder on analysis, probability and statistics
    \item OpenTURNS platform: the global picture of OpenTURNS product and the website, short presentation of the development life-cycle.
    \item Architecture: the general organization of the product with some highlights on the key mechanisms and their implementation.
    \item The development infrastructure: some elements on CMake.
    \item The development process: architecture, C++ implementation, doxygen, tests.
 %\item Experimentation: basic manipulation of a numerical function and a probability distribution, navigation in the website (tickets, versioning system), exploration of examples in C++ and python.
    %\item Selection of the challenges.
    \end{itemize}

    \begin{itemize}
    \item The concept of module, its standard structure.
    \item The key steps in the development of a module.
    \item How to install and use a module?

  \frametitle{Already a contributor}
  \begin{block}{You are a new OpenTURNS developer!}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item All the developments made during this training session will become part of OpenTURNS sooner or later, depending on their degree of maturity (quality ;) ?).
    \item The missing steps for a direct integration will be the testing phase, the validation phase and probably parts of the documentation phase.
    \item The integration will be done using a development branch on GitHub.
    \end{itemize}
    Check the upcoming release or the next to see your work in action!
